## Introduction

Physical AI Bench (PAI-Bench) is a comprehensive benchmark suite for evaluating physical AI generation and understanding. PAI-Bench covers physical scenarios including autonomous vehicle (AV) driving, robotics, industry (smart space) and ego-centric everyday. PAI-Bench contains three subtasks:

- **Predict**: Evaluates world foundation models' ability to predict future states given current states and control signals
- **Transfer**: Focuses on world model generation capabilities with more complex control signals such as edges, segmentation masks, depth, etc.
- **Reason**: Evaluates understanding of physical scenes.
